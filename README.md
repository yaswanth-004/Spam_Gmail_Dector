## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Cloud Console account (for Gmail API)
- VirusTotal account (for malware scanning - optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gmail-spam-scanner
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up Gmail API**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Gmail API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app)
   - Download credentials and save as `credentials.json` in project root
   - To create a credentials.json file for the Gmail API, you must generate either an OAuth 2.0 client ID (for user authentication) or a Service Account key in the Google Cloud Console and download the resulting JSON file. 
Method 1: OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Recommended for most user-facing apps) 
This method is used when your application needs to access a user's data with their permission. 
Go to the Google Cloud Console: Open the Google Cloud Console and select your project, or create a new one.
Enable the Gmail API:
In the left-side menu, go to APIs & Services > Library.
Search for "Gmail API", select it, and click Enable.
Configure the OAuth Consent Screen:
In the left-side menu, go to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen.
Select the user type (e.g., External) and click Create.
Fill in the required fields, such as the app name and a support email, then click Save and Continue.
On the Scopes page, you can optionally add the specific Gmail API scopes your application needs. Click Save and Continue.
Add test users if needed, then go back to the dashboard.
Create Credentials:
In the left-side menu, go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
Click + Create Credentials and select OAuth client ID.
Select your application type (e.g., Desktop app, Web application, etc.).
Give the credential a name.
If you chose "Web application", add the authorized redirect URIs for your application.
Click Create.
Download the JSON file: A dialog box will appear with your Client ID and Client Secret. Click the Download JSON button to save the credentials.json file to your computer. 

4. **Configure environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your VirusTotal API key:
```
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Get your free VirusTotal API key: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us

5. **Add your AI model files**

Place these files in the project root:
- `spam_model.pkl` - Your trained spam detection model
- `vectorizer.pkl` - Your text vectorizer

## 🎯 Usage

### Command Line Interface

Run the CLI version:
```bash
python gmail_scanner.py
```

Follow the prompts to:
1. Authenticate with Gmail
2. Select folder to scan
3. Configure filters
4. View results

### Web Interface (Recommended)

Launch the Streamlit web app:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Then:
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`
2. Click "Connect to Gmail"
3. Configure scan settings
4. Click "Start Scan"
5. View and filter results in the dashboard

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ✅ What IS Secure

- API keys stored in `.env` file (never committed to GitHub)
- OAuth 2.0 for Gmail authentication
- `.gitignore` prevents sensitive files from being pushed
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse


### 🛡️ Recommended Setup

1. Always use `.env` for API keys
2. Never hardcode credentials in code
3. Use different API keys for development and production
4. Regularly rotate your API keys
5. Set up 2FA on your Google account

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```bash
# Gmail API
GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials.json

# VirusTotal API
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Optional: Rate limiting (seconds between requests)
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=15
```

### Rate Limiting

- **Free VirusTotal**: 4 requests/minute, 500 requests/day
- **Built-in delay**: 15 seconds between requests (configurable)
- **URL limit**: Scans first 3 URLs per email
- **Attachment limit**: Scans first 3 attachments per email

## 📊 AI Model Training

To train your own spam detection model:

1. Prepare dataset (CSV with 'text' and 'label' columns)
2. Use scikit-learn to train a classifier
3. Save model and vectorizer using joblib:

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'spam_model.pkl')
joblib.dump(vectorizer, 'vectorizer.pkl')
```

4. Place files in project root

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "credentials.json not found"
- Download OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
- Place in project root directory

### "VirusTotal API key not configured"
- Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
- Add your VirusTotal API key
- Restart the application

### "401 Unauthorized" from VirusTotal
- Verify API key is correct
- Check if email is verified on VirusTotal account
- Ensure no extra spaces in API key

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait 1 minute before next scan
- Reduce number of emails per scan
- Increase RATE_LIMIT_DELAY in .env

### AI Model not loading
- Ensure `spam_model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` are in project root
- Check file permissions
- Verify files are not corrupted

## 📝 API Usage Limits

- 1 billion quota units per day
- ~250 requests per user per second
